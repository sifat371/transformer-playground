# transformer-playground

This project contains experiments and code for deep learning model foundations, including CNNs and RNNs, using PyTorch.

## What I've done

- Set up a Python virtual environment for reproducible experiments.
- Installed PyTorch with GPU support and verified CUDA availability.
- Implemented and trained a simple CNN on the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluated model accuracy and printed training progress.
- Managed Python environments and Jupyter kernels for clean workspace usage.
- Troubleshot and resolved issues with CUDA, matplotlib backends, and package installations.
- Used Git for version control and pushed code to a remote repository.
